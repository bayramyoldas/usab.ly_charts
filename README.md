# usab.ly_charts
Small project that developed for "Developing Interactive Systems" course and will part of usab.ly project.

What does this do? 
From chartcontrol.php page, you can add different kind of charts (pie chart, bar chart, etc. - for now only piechart available). For add a chart, you must enter a chart title and elements of chart. The elements of charts form is dynamic, so you can add fields dynamically. And then, chart infos will be saved to db, you will be able to see it on main page.
